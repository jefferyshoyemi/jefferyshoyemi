- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was literally a bug! In 1947, Grace Hopper, a pioneering computer scientist, found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. The bug was removed, and Hopper famously recorded it as the "first actual case of a bug being found." This is where the term "debugging" comes from!
